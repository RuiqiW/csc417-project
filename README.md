## Execution
After compiling the project, you can run the following command inside the `build/` folder to see the simulation of 2 scenarios.  



Dropping water into an empty cube container (no animation).

```
./fluid n

```

Dropping water into an empty cube container (with the animation).

```
./fluid y 
```

Dropping water into an cube container with a rabbit inside (no animation).
```
./fluid n rabbit
```

Dropping water into an cube container with a rabbit inside (with the animation).
```
./fluid y rabbit
```

If you choose the visualization without animation, press "n/N" to get to the next timestep for fluid simulation, and press "r/R" to reset all particles' positions and velocities.
